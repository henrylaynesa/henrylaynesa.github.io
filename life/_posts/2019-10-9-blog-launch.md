**Hi and welcome to my first post!** :tada: :confetti_ball: :tada: :confetti_ball: :tada: :confetti_ball: 

I'm happy to share to everyone what I have and will be up to. I'm a bit late in making my own blog but better late than never!

I made this blog because:

- I want to improve my presence online and in the industry.
- I'll be able to reach and collaborate with more people this way.
- This shall serve as my portfolio!
- I wanted to try out web development again (even just for a little bit).
- Having a personal website is cool :sunglasses:!

I'll be honest I jumped in the bandwagon when everyone was making a GitHub page. :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
