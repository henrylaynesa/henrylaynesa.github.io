<strong>Hi, I'm Henry</strong> and welcome to my blog!

I'm a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science fresh graduate from [University of the Philippines Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/) looking to start a career in Data Science where I can apply my technical expertise in machine learning to create high-impact for social good.

I'm mainly interested in machine learning, data science, and software engineering!
