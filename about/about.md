Hi, I'm Henry Laynesa Jr and welcome to my blog!

I'm a machine learning and data science enthusiast. I started this site to document my thoughts, learnings, and achievements in my tech adventure. I aim to use my skills in tech for self-stability and social good.

Feel free to hit me up to talk about how we can help each other reach our goals!
