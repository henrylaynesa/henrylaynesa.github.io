Hi, I'm **Henry Laynesa Jr** and welcome to my blog!

I'm a machine learning and data science enthusiast. I started this site to document my thoughts, learnings, and achievements in my tech adventure. I aim to use my skills in tech to create high-impact solutions for self-stability and social good.

Feel free to hit me up and talk about how we can help each other reach our goals!

## Background

I graduated from [University of the Philippines Diliman](https://upd.edu.ph/) in June of 2019 with a degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Part of our course work is learning about artificial intelligence and machine learning. I also did my thesis as an undegraduate member of [UP Computer Vision and Machine Learning Intelligence Group](https://www.facebook.com/upcvmig/) in AY18-19. I got fond of the discipline and decided to learn more about the potential machine learning carries. 

As someone who's generally curious about how and why things work and someone who's an ML nerd, I found data science to be both an interesting hobby and a solid career option! I took a bootcamp with [Eskwelabs](https://www.eskwelabs.com) as an Eskwelabs Data Science Fellow to complete my skillset in data science and to meet like-minded people.

I've had an internship before as a Software Engineer Intern in [Azeus](https://www.azeus.com/). I mainly worked as a backend developer which made me comfortable with handling databases.
